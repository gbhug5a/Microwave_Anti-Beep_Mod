## Microwave Anti-Beep Mod

### Prevent the microwave from beeping five times when cooking completes

My Magic Chef microwave beeps five times when a cooking countdown completes.  It continues the beep even after you've opened the door, which is very annoying.  I can prevent the beep by pressing the Stop key twice before the time reaches zero, which stops the countdown early. So I thought I could add a microcontroller circuit which detects when the display has counted down to one second, and then "presses" the Stop button twice.  The PDF describes how this was done.

Note that my microwave is a Magic Chef model HNN1110W, bought in 2020.  I believe Home Depot still sells that model, but its electronics may have changed.  Also be aware that microwave ovens are connected to the mains, and store very high voltages in their capacitors, and can be dangerous to life and health.  Please don't mess with your oven if you aren't experienced in electronics.
